                We'll officially form the DAO based on Brazil laws and make sure
                every decision is decentralized by the community, we believe
                that droids together are stronger. We'll use something like
                https://snapshot.org/ to do the DAOs voting and be very
                transparent and over communicating everything as we've past
                experience managing a huge team or a top tier $SOL collection.
